## Whose hardware is this, anyway?

During your Ph.D. or, sometimes, undergraduate work, you will acquire hardware that appears to be "from me" to assist with your research.
This hardware is funded by a grant or some other money issued to my research program through the institute.
Georgia Tech owns all work and hardware conducted under the auspices of Georgia Tech.
Thus, _you do not own the laptop, workstation, or any other hardware issued to you_ for research purposes (I also do not own it!).
As such, you are required to return all hardware upon graduation or when leaving the research group.
Given this, it is your responsibility to __take care of the hardware issued to you, not physically abusing or modifying it__.
It may well be used by someone else in the future.

If you feel uncomfortable being responsible for hardware, like a laptop, that you do not own, please let Spencer know.

__Note:__ This does __not__ mean that if something happens to your laptop or other hardware, you are personally responsible (nor will I be upset)! Such things happen, and over the course of a Ph.D., they are not entirely unlikely. Your responsibility is quite simple and hopefully easy to abide by: do not intentionally modify or abuse the hardware, and the overarching point of the document is clarification of ownership (which is often not obvious to students).

__Aside:__ At time of writing, I only purchase MacBooks for myself and student researchers. There are several reasons for this. Some examples that come to mind are MacOS being UNIX-based with strong software adoption (from native builds of linear algebra libraries to the MS Office suite) and Apple laptops having high quality standards, long battery life, and reliable use for presentations.
